## Overview
So, this is an amazing project that help me a lot to improve my skills of ReactJS. It is about a ToDo list that the user can see the tasks that remains to do, besides can filter the elements and remove the ones that already completed, and changed theme. All the data is saved and when the page has updated, you don't lose the ones. 

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Add new todos to the list
- Mark todos as complete
- Delete todos from the list
- Filter by all/active/complete todos
- Clear all completed todos
- Toggle light and dark mode

## My process
Initialy i created the basic estruture surrounding the global list that will be the reference to all project. I divide the components and worked in each one like a piece to piece. I through for some issues, like the matches between id objets and the global array but i can figure out and it worked XD
